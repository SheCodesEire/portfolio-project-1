#### Landing Page Features: 

**Hero Image and Cover Text:** The hero image displays an image of a Volkswagen Van, providing immediate context for the site user. The text overlay includes a catchy slogan to add to the professionalism of the site and helps the site user to better understand the company’s brand. The hero image includes a zoom effect to add visual appeal.

#### Menu Page Features: 

**Menu Panels:** 
Three clean and concise panels provide information on the business’s set menu and pricing. The menu items are organised with information hierarchy in mind; breakfast items are presented first, followed by lunch items and finally drinks and snacks. Each menu item has a creative name to add interest for the user. These panels are responsive and will re-arrange to a column format on smaller screens. There is a strong contrast between the text and background colour to enable easy reading for visually impaired site users.

### Features Not Yet Implemented

**Online Orders:** There is scope for an online ordering feature that would allow customers to place their order online prior to their visit to reduce waiting times.


## Design

Wireframes: 

This site was designed using pen and paper sketches initially followed by wireframes created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzY2bBhB6EiwAPpUpZiC_r2yCcRAPVgL-qLMz8Ii7YTAcwitZP7q-l_gcA9LcTbEchPfaQxoCLG8QAvD_BwE). Please find a selection of the completed wireframes below;

<br>

**Sample 3 : Contact Page (for desktop)**

<br>

### Typography: 

This website uses the following two fonts;
- [Playfair Display.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display/about?query=play)
- [Source Sans Pro.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro/about?query=Source+sans+pro)

These fonts were selected for their readability and simplistic style. This font pairing was inspired by the following [blog post](https://www.creativebloq.com/typography/20-perfect-type-pairings-3132120) written by Ruth Hamilton. 


### Imagery: 

All images were obtained from the [Unsplash website](https://unsplash.com/) and compressed using [Compress JPG](https://compressjpeg.com/) to improve page loading times. The hero image on the landing page represents a VW van, providing immediate context to the user. The flip card images attempt to demonstrate the healthy, colourful meals available for purchase. Finally, the background images on the menu and contact pages convey beautiful scenery to reflect the business’s surroundings. 

### Colour Scheme: 

The colour scheme includes earthy, neutral and inviting tones. This creates a relaxed atmosphere and reflects the brand identity as an environmentally conscious business. Links, buttons, and backgrounds are styled using the same colours to create a consistent experience for the user. 

## Languages 

This website was developed using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

## Testing 

**Responsiveness:** 
This site was tested for responsiveness using chrome developer tools. Media queries were added for six breakpoints to cater for a wide range of screen sizes. Four breakpoints were selected using current best practice guidelines set out by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp). An additional two breakpoints were selected to solve a specific sizing issue relevant to the site in question. 

Please find a summary of the main changes added at each breakpoint below: 

**Max-width 1300px:** This breakpoint was used to improve the layout and content of the menu panels for larger screens. 

**Max-width 992px:** At this breakpoint, the menu panels and flip cards both switch to a column layout for easy reading on smaller screens. This breakpoint was also used to modify the layout and styling of the nav menu and contact form for smaller screens. 

**Max-width 768px:** Both the reviews section and primary containers on the contact page switch to a column layout for improved readibility. Of note, at this breakpoint the contact form container displays first, followed by the contact information container to ensure that the most important information is displayed first for site user. The size of several headings and sections of text is reduced to improve readibility on smaller screens. 

**Max-width 600px:** Text size reduces and the footer container switches to a "wrap" layout. 

**Max-width 583px:** This breakpoint was included to solve a bug within the navigation bar. Without this media query, there is an excess of padding above the navigation bar on small screens.  

**Max-width: 480px:** Font size is reduced for text within the menu panels for mobile devices. The containers within the contact page are styled to fit more neatly on mobile screens. 


During the testing phase, this site was successfully loaded on a several mobile devices, an i-pad, a small laptop and a large desktop screen.

**Browser Testing**

This browser was tested for functionality on the following browsers with nil issues identified:
- Mozilla Firefox
- Bing
- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome 

**Validation Testing**

The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to test the html code for the home, menu and contact pages.  Some errors were noted initially and minor changes were made to the code, including the following;

- Several h1 elements were changed to h2 elements to ensure that only on h1 element existed per page. 
- Two id selectors responsible for styling the front of the landing page flip cards were switched to class selectors. This ensured that no duplicate ids existed within the code. Additional styling was then added to the front of each flip card using two separate unique id selectors.
- Two duplicate id selectors responsible for styling the button links on the landing page were switched to class selectors. 


Following these changes, nil errors reported were reported for all html code. 

The CSS code was tested using the W3C Jigsaw Validation Service. Nil errors were noted. 

**Performance Testing** 
The Lighthouse performance tool was used to test all pages and the results are as follows;

**Home Page:**

**Menu Page:**

<img src="assets/images/menu-lighthouse.png" alt="screenshot of lighthouse report for menu page">

**Contact Page:**

<img src="assets/images/contact-lighthouse.png" alt="screenshot of lighthouse report for contact page">


Of note, performance scores were reduced due to large network payloads. Images, font and icon downloads contributed to this. All images were compressed to improve loading times. The performance score could be improved upon in the future by reducing network payloads and serving images in more modern formats such as WebP and AVIF. 

**Manual Testing**

Please find a summary table of all manual testing completed below:
